  title: [From Data to Degrees - Using Machine Learning Models to Predict Tomorrow's Temperatures],
  abstract: [
   The dataset used for this project is titled "Climate Change: Earth Surface Temperature Data," compiled by Berkeley Earth. The link for this dataset is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data?resource=download. It contains five CSV files in a zip file, including global temperatures by state, major city, country, and city. Due to the extensive dates covered, starting from 1750 to 2013, the data allows for analysis of global climate change. Each of the five extensive CSV files contains consistent variables: Date, Average Temperature, and Average Temparature Uncertainty. Immediately, the date formatting was observed to be disorganized and both the average temperature and uncertainty data was randomly sparse. The date column is recorded as both year/month/date and month/date/year and the two temperature columns are in units of Celsius throughout each dataset. Climate change is one of the most pressing global issues in 21st century. Rising of temperature, shifting of weather patterns and increasing of extreme events are no longer distant concerns but immediate threats to ecosystems and human well-being. In this project, we aim to conduct climate research by using historical temperature data and machine learning techniques to generate accurate temperature forecasts. Such predictions are not only crucial for advancing climate science but also have practical applications in areas such as energy sustainability, infrastructure planning, and public health. Once a clean and pre-processed dataset has been obtained this study aims to employ a predictive machine learning model(s) to predict the behavior of future global temperatures. The dataset used in this study will be parsed into training, validation, and testing datasets. The model will learn patterns and trends over time and in turn be able to predict future temperatures based on past observations. Capturing features such as seasonal cycles, weather patterns, and relevant trends and anomalies will be integral to the accuracy of our model. The hope is that this project will serve as a baseline for climatologists and other like-minded researchers interested in understanding and predicting the impacts of the Anthropocene on our climate.],

= Exploratory Data Analysis 



== First Subsection

To add figures to your report, save the image file in the `figures` folder and use the `#figure` command as shown below to include it in your document. You can specify the width of the image and add a caption. Then you can reference the figure like this: @proofread.

#figure(
  image("figures/proof-read.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [A humble request. (Copyright: University of the Fraser Valley.)],
) <proofread>

=== First Subsubsection

You can make sub, sub-sub, and sub-sub-sub sections by adding `=` signs in front of the section title. There needs to be a space between the last `=` sign and the title text.

= Predictive Modeling

You can add tables using the `#table` command. Here is an example table:

#figure(
  caption: [Example Table],
  table(
    columns: (auto, auto, auto),
    table.header([*Column 1*], [*Column 2*], [*Column 3*]),
    "Row 1", "Data 1", [Data 2],
    image("figures/proof-read.png", width: 40%), "Data 3", "Data 4",
  ),
) <table-example>

You can reference the table like this: @table-example.
