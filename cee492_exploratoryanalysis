= Exploratory Data Analysis 



== First Subsection

To add figures to your report, save the image file in the `figures` folder and use the `#figure` command as shown below to include it in your document. You can specify the width of the image and add a caption. Then you can reference the figure like this: @proofread.

#figure(
  image("figures/proof-read.png", width: 80%),
  caption: [A humble request. (Copyright: University of the Fraser Valley.)],
) <proofread>

=== First Subsubsection

You can make sub, sub-sub, and sub-sub-sub sections by adding `=` signs in front of the section title. There needs to be a space between the last `=` sign and the title text.

= Predictive Modeling

You can add tables using the `#table` command. Here is an example table:

#figure(
  caption: [Example Table],
  table(
    columns: (auto, auto, auto),
    table.header([*Column 1*], [*Column 2*], [*Column 3*]),
    "Row 1", "Data 1", [Data 2],
    image("figures/proof-read.png", width: 40%), "Data 3", "Data 4",
  ),
) <table-example>

You can reference the table like this: @table-example.
